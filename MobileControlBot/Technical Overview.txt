🚗 Project Title: Mobile Control Bot

Category: Embedded Systems | RoboticsPlatform: Arduino

🛠️ Overview

This was my first embedded systems project, which introduced me to microcontroller-based hardware interfacing and Bluetooth communication. The bot was manually controlled via a smartphone app, establishing a simple yet functional mobile robot system.

🔧 Components Used

Component

Description

Arduino Uno

Main microcontroller for control logic

HC-05 Bluetooth Module

Wireless communication with Android phone

L293D Motor Driver

Controls the bidirectional movement of motors

DC Geared Motors (x2)

Used for left and right wheel movement

AA Battery Pack

Powers the motor driver and motors

9V Battery

Powers the Arduino Uno

Chassis & Wheels

Base structure for the robot

📱 Control Mechanism

Communication: HC-05 Bluetooth module

Controller App: Arduino Bluetooth Controller (from Play Store)

Commands: Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop

🔄 Working Principle

The Bluetooth module receives directional commands from the smartphone.

Arduino Uno reads incoming serial data and determines motion logic.

Based on the command, Arduino controls the L293D motor driver to drive the motors in the desired direction.

🔌 Power Supply Details

Arduino powered by a 9V battery

Motor driver powered by AA battery pack (4x1.5V = 6V)
