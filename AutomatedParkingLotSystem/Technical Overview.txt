### **Project Title: Automated Parking Lot Monitoring and Access Control System**

**Overview:**
The Automated Parking Lot Monitoring and Access Control System is a smart embedded solution designed to manage vehicle parking efficiently in a residential or commercial building. The system features four dedicated parking slots, each monitored by ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) to detect vehicle presence. A real-time display system shows slot availability, and an automated gate mechanism allows vehicle entry only when a slot is available.

**Objective:**
To develop a low-cost, real-time, automated parking management system using embedded technologies that improves vehicle flow and eliminates manual supervision.

### **System Architecture:**

The system integrates multiple hardware modules to carry out sensing, processing, display, and actuation tasks:

* **Input Units:**

  * 4 × HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors: Mounted above each parking slot to measure distance and detect vehicle presence.

* **Processing Unit:**

  * Arduino  Nano Collects sensor data, processes occupancy status, and controls gate actuation.

* **Output Units:**

  * 16x2 LCD or OLED Display: Shows parking slot availability in real time.
  * Servo Motor SG90: Opens and closes the entrance gate based on slot availability.

* **Power Supply:**

  * 9V DC Adapter: Powers the microcontroller and peripheral devices.

### **Features:**

* Real-time detection of parking slot occupancy using non-contact sonar sensors.
* Dynamic LCD display showing the availability status (e.g., Slot 1: Available / Occupied).
* Automatic gate opening only when one or more slots are free.
* "Parking Full" indication when all slots are occupied.
* Scalable design architecture for adding more slots as needed.
* Compact and cost-effective solution for small facilities.

### **Working Principle:**

1. The ultrasonic sensors send out continuous pulses to detect the distance of any object (vehicle) present above each parking slot.
2. If the measured distance is below a predefined threshold, the slot is marked as occupied.
3. The Arduino processes all sensor data and updates the display accordingly.
4. If any slot is available, the system sends a control signal to the gate motor to open the gate, allowing vehicle entry.
5. If all slots are full, the gate remains closed and a "Parking Full" message is displayed.

### **Use Cases / Applications:**

* Residential apartment complexes with limited parking capacity
* Office buildings requiring automated parking entry systems
* Educational institutions as a teaching model for embedded systems and automation
* Prototyping platform for smart city parking solutions

---

### **Future Improvements:**

* Integration with mobile apps for remote monitoring and booking of parking slots
* Use of RFID or ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) for secure access
* Cloud-based data logging for usage statistics and analytics
* Wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi or LoRa) to integrate with smart city infrastructure

---

**Conclusion:**
This project showcases a practical implementation of embedded systems in solving real-world problems. With a compact and modular design, the Automated Parking Lot Monitoring and Access Control System offers an effective solution for managing parking space efficiently and securely.
